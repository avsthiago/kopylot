Kopylot is an open-source AI-powered Kubernetes assistant. Its goal is to help developers and DevOps engineers to easily manage and monitor their Kubernetes clusters. 

KoPylot's idea is similar to [Kopilot](https://github.com/knight42/kopilot) from knight42. The main difference at the moment is the usage of Python for implementing it. 

> *Note from the author*: I decided to create a new project instead of contributing to Kopilot mainly because I am a Python developer, and Kopilot is written in Go. I also believe that the tools for interacting with large language models are more mature in the Python ecosystem.
